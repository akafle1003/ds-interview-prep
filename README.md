# Data Science Interview Prep
### Interview questions &amp; collection of materials.

I kept losing all the practice interview questions I developed, so here is a repo for everyone to benefit. Happy practicing!

### [1. Basic Python Questions](python-qs.md)

These are questions that test basic python functionality, knowing the different functions of sets, dictionaries, lists, enumerate, zip, etc.

### [2. Algorithm Questions](algo-qs.md)

These can be found all over the internet, so these are a collection of questions that I particularly like

### [3. Stat Questions](stats-qs.md)

These are basic probability questions

#### [4. Experiment Questions](experiment-qs.md)

This is a separate category of understanding how to separate population groups and testing different types of hypothesis. Covers, power, one sample groups, and two sample groups

### [5. Data Science Questions](datascience-qs.md)

This covers designing ML models, and understanding results. Also coveres training, validation, and testing sets. 

### 6. Modeling Questions(model-design.md)

This covers product related questions. These are often asked at internet product companies. 

### [7. Product Questions](product-qs.md)

This covers product related questions. These are often asked at internet product companies. 

### [8. Northwind SQL Questions](northwind-sql-qs.md)

These are SQL questions that are intended to be worked out in a paired programming example against a postgresql database

### [9. SQL White Board Questions](whiteboard-sql-qs.md)

These are simplified SQL questions that are intended not to be coded, but worked out on a whiteboard.
