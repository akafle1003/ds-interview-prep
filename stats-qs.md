## Typical basic stat questions

This is a compilation of questions from both my master's program, stat trek, and some other stat website.



### Probability

```
Define a p-value
```

```
A car has a 0.9 probability of passing a store every 30 mins. What is the probability of the car passing every 15 min?
```

```
Conversely: A car has a 0.4 probabiliyt of passing a bench at a 15 min interval. What's the probability of a car passing within a 45 min interval?
```

```
Three friends in Seattle told you it's rainy. Each has a probability of 1/3 of lying. What's the probability that Seattle is rainy?
```

```
What is the fundamentals of naive bayes? How do you set the threshold?
```

```
Whats the difference between bayesian and frequentist view of stats?
```

```
given n samples from a uniform distribution [0,d]
how to estimate d?
```

```
Flip a coin three times. Lext X be the number of heads observed. Write down a probability mass function p(x) that characterizes the way that X allocates probability to the integers 0, 1, 2, and 3
```

```
A graduate class consists of six students. What is the probability taht exactly three of them are born either in April or in October?
```

```
Suppose that 2.5% of the population of a border town are illegal immigrants. Find the pro ability that in a theater of his town with 80 random viewers, there are at least two illegal immigrants
```

```
The probabilty is p that a randomly-chosen light bulb is defective. We screw a bulb into a lamp and switch on the current. If the build works, we stop; otherwise, we try another and continue until a good bulb is found. What is the probability that at least n bulbs are required?
```

```
Consider a coin that is flipped 34 times and comes up heads 15 times. You do not know what the true proportion of the time it is that this coin will come up heads. Build a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of times the coin will come up heads.
```

```
Using the confidence interval that you constructed in the previous problem, would you reject H_0 = 0.75 in favor of its two sided alternative at the 5% level of significance? Why or why not?
```

```
For the scores on an achievement test given to a certain population of students, the expected value is 500 and the standard deviation is 100. Let X_bar be the mean of hte scores of a random sample of 35 students from the population. What does the central limit say the approximate distribution of X_bar is ? then compute the pro babilty that X_bar is between 460 and 540. (Hint: if Z=(X-u))
