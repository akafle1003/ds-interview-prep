## Typical basic stat questions

This is a compilation of questions from both my master's program, stat trek, and some other stat website.



### Probability

```
Define a p-value
```

```
A car has a 0.9 probability of passing a store every 30 mins. What is the probability of the car passing every 15 min?
```

```
Conversely: A car has a 0.4 probabiliyt of passing a bench at a 15 min interval. What's the probability of a car passing within a 45 min interval?
```
